Unfortunately, web game development still takes a back seat to environments driven by say, Unity or Unreal. Some developers do not consider web game development to be a ""serious"" platform.

2. As a web game developer, other non-game dev frameworks might be involved, such as React. As someone who solely uses the Canvas / WebGL (through Phaser), these tools can get in the way. While it might help, I don't think it should be strictly necessary to know web development frameworks, just to make games that run in a web browser.

3. Back-end development. As the space becomes more competitive, you'll need ways to stand out. Knowing back-end technologies (at the very least, servers, databases, user profiles/auth) are becoming more important. ",

My focus remains on creating engaging and creative indie games that prioritize storytelling and gameplay. However, I do keep an eye on emerging technologies to explore how they might enhance player experiences in the future.","The rapid growth of AI has significantly impacted my work as an indie game developer. AI tools have streamlined many aspects of the development process, from generating procedural content to improving game mechanics. For example, AI-assisted art tools help create assets faster, and AI-driven testing tools identify bugs and balance issues more efficiently.  Additionally, integrating AI into gameplay allows for more dynamic NPC behavior, making games like Tofu Quest more engaging and immersive for players. Overall, AI has amplified creativity and productivity, enabling me to focus more on storytelling and game design.",10,"No, I’m not facing any major problems with game development at the moment. If challenges arise, I rely on AI tools and online resources to find solutions quickly, whether it’s for debugging, optimizing performance, or generating creative ideas. This has been a game-changer for improving efficiency and quality in my projects.","One of the biggest challenges faced by the game development community in 2024 is the high competition due to the influx of new developers. With accessible tools and platforms, more creators are entering the market, making it harder to stand out and gain visibility.

This saturation also raises the bar for innovation and quality, as players have countless options to choose from. Balancing originality with market trends, as well as effectively marketing games in a crowded space, remains a key challenge for indie and small-scale developers.","In addition to competition, another challenge is keeping up with the rapid pace of technological advancements. Developers need to adapt quickly to new tools, platforms, and player expectations, which can be overwhelming.

It’s also worth mentioning the importance of fostering community support and collaboration. By sharing knowledge and resources, developers can navigate these challenges together and continue to push the boundaries of creativity and innovation in game development."
